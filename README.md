# blurry-bg

Blurrify images from the internet.
I wanted a way to make blurred background images for video calls with zoom/meets/ms Teams.
 1. Copy/paste the url of an image you find on the internet that you can legally copy.
 2. Adjust bluriness, if necessary
 3. Take a screen cap
 4. You can also cycle through to view/remove the images
